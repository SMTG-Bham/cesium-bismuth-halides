Optimised crystal structures of Cs<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>X<sub>9</sub> (X = Br, I) from density functional theory, calculated using the Vienna *Ab initio* Package (VASP). Only the lowest energy configurations for each stoichiometry up to I=6 are given.

Computational Details
-----------------------
The crystal structure of Cs<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>9</sub> was used as the starting point for the calculation of all substituted phases.

The stuctures were optimised using the PBEsol functional.
The final structures have been obtained following an iterative procedure where the ion positions, cell shape, and cell volume are allowed to change (`ISIF = 3` in VASP) using a Quasi-Newton algorithm.

Requirements
